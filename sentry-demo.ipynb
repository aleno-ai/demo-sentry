    "# Sentry Demo\n",
    "Welcome to the interactive demonstration of Aleno's Sentry API, crafted specifically for DeFi Asset Managers. This notebook is designed to guide you through the powerful features of Sentry, an advanced alerting system that enables meticulous monitoring of financial risks across DeFi platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Documentation\n",
    "For detailed information about all available API routes and features, please consult our official [documentation](https://docs.aleno.ai).\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective\n",
    "In this demonstration, you'll learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to configure simple alerts using Sentry\n",
    "- How to visualize the recent metrics variations\n",
    "- How to set up Sentry to send customized alerts directly to your Telegram, integrated via [Zapier](https://zapier.com/).\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you'll be able to customize Sentry alerts to fit your DeFi portfolio needs, improving your asset management and risk reduction strategies.\n",

    "#### Metrics Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently Sentry Api supports a set 6 types of metrics that will rapidly grow. Metrics can be split into 2 types.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Token metrics**: These metrics allows to track the activity of a given asset across DeFi.\n",
    "- **Pool metrics**: These metrics allows to monitor the activity of an AMM's pool. Most of AMM are currently supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently supported metrics are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Token metrics:\n",
    "- **Token Total TVL**: This metric represent the total amount of liquid asset in AMMs pools. Alerts are triggered as soon as the aggregated TVL of all pools of a token highly increases/decreases in a block or a user-defined time window.\n",
    "- **Token Total Supply**: Alerts are triggered as soon as the total supply of a given token highly increases/decreases in a block or a user-defined time window. This is useful to monitor LRT/LST total deposited amount as the total supply of an LRT is equal to the amount of ETH deposited\n",
    "- **Token USD price**: Alerts are triggered as soon as the USD price of a token highly increases/decreases in a block or a user-defined time window.\n",
    "- **Token WETH price**: Alerts are triggered as soon as the WETH price of a token highly increases/decreases in a block or a user-defined time window. \n",
    " \n",
    " Pool metrics:\n",
    " - **Pool TVL**:  Alerts are triggered as soon as the TVL of a pool highly increases/decreases in a block or a user-defined time window. This metric can allow to monitor pool draining or large token dumps.\n",
    " - **Pool Rates**:  Alerts are triggered as soon as the rate of a pool highly increases/decreases in a block or a user-defined time window.\n",
    "\n",
    " A complete list of upcoming metrics can be found in our official [documentation](https://docs.aleno.ai).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Within Sentry, each metric can be identified by its **key**. There are several methods to find a relevant metric to subscribe to, including recreating the key based on known parameters or using suggestion routes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. Reconstruct a metric key\n",
    "\n",
    "A metric key is in the form of:`chainId_metricType_parameters`. By replacing the ``{address}` parameter in the key, you could retrieve any metric if it is supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Token TVL**: eth_token_total_tvl_{tokenAddress}\n",
    "- **Token Supply**: eth_token_total_supply_{tokenAddress}\n",
    "- **Token Weth**: eth_token_weth_price_{tokenAddress}\n",
    "- **Token USD price**: eth_token_usd_price_{tokenAddress}\n",
    "- **Pool TVL**: eth_pool_tvl_{poolAddress}_{tokenAddress}\n",
    "- **Pool Rate**: eth_pool_rate_{poolAddress}_{baseTokenAddress}_{quoteTokenAddress}\n",
